## [RM-002] Real-time connection between web and API (2026-10-29 19:39)
The API echoes WebSocket messages on `/api/ws` (`coder/websocket`, first dependency); the home page connects to its own origin, sends what you type and lists what comes back, with the connection status.

## [RM-001] Deploy to Render (2026-10-29 18:59)
One image from `apps/docker/Dockerfile`: Go serves the API under `/api/` and the Angular build for everything else, as a single free Render Web Service.
Render's free tier can't host a private API, so two services would sleep apart; one container wakes whole and keeps the web on the API's origin.
