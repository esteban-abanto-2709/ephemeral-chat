# Ephemeral Chat — Web

Ephemeral Chat's interface. An Angular single-page app: it compiles to static
files that any web server can serve. It talks to the [API](../api/README.md).

## Stack

| Piece           | Version                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime         | Node.js 24 (build only)                       |
| Framework       | Angular 22 (standalone, zoneless, no SSR)     |
| UI              | Tailwind CSS 4                                |
| Tests           | Vitest on jsdom                               |
| Package manager | pnpm (pinned in `package.json`, via corepack) |

## Getting started

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm start          # http://localhost:4200
```

`ng serve` proxies `/api` to the API on `http://localhost:8080`
(`proxy.conf.json`), so the web always calls its own origin, as it does in
production. Run the API with `go run .` in `apps/api` for anything that needs
it.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm start                 # dev server with reload
pnpm run build             # production build to dist/web/browser
pnpm test                  # Vitest in watch mode
pnpm test --watch=false    # single run
```

## Conventions

Read [`docs/angular.md`](../../docs/angular.md) before writing any component, service or
template.

## Dependency build scripts

pnpm 11 blocks dependency install scripts unless they are listed in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`allowBuilds`). In Docker an unlisted one fails the
install. When a new dependency needs one, decide it there: `true` to run it,
`false` if the package ships prebuilt binaries.

## In production

There is no web server of its own: the build in `dist/web/browser` is served
by the Go API from the single image in [`apps/docker`](../docker/README.md).
